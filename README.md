* Hey group, So I have the web-page up and running on the master branch. If you view it from a desktop it looks all messed up but from mobile it looks alright.

* what I would like to work on further is getting the layout on mobile to be more balanced and nicer in general.

* the color scheme I picked can be changed if you want to mess around with that. the answer page is pretty cluttered and I could not figure out how to get the header to stay flush up with the top of the screen.

* the submit button on the multiplying page has no text because I could not get it centered vertically and horizontally. personally I think It looks alright without text, but if someone wants to try and figure that out and get text into the button then go for it.

* to Caitlin, I still have not integrated your user input idea into my javaScript yet but will work on that tomorrow. I am thinking of adding a small button to the top of the screen that drops down a menu to pick which numbers to focus on.

* When working on re-styling, when you inspect the page make sure to pick the mobile option to see what your changes will look like on a smartPhone. Getting it looking nice on mobile is the main concern now. Do not worry about desktop appearance.
